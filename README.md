# JD-GOC-VRP
VRPTW variation of JD Global Optimization Challange


Algorithm summary:
1. Generate an initial solution based on Time-oriented Nearest-Neighborhood Heuristic proposed by Solomon(1987).
2. Improve the initial solution using Large Neighbourhood Search algorithm and Simulated Annealing algorithm. We used 7 operators to search neighborhood solution.
3. Other implementation skills.
